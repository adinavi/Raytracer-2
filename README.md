# Ray Tracer

A simple ray tracing program that renders a scene with a sphere and a plane, employing basic lighting and shading techniques, including gradient coloring.

## Features

- Renders a red-to-blue gradient sphere based on the surface normal.
- Implements diffuse lighting from a light source positioned above the sphere.
- Includes a gray plane for additional scene depth.
- Generates a background gradient to simulate a sky.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Basic understanding of C++ and ray tracing concepts
